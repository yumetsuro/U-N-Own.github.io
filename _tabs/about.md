## About me
I'm Vincenzo Gargano i'm a student in Artificial Intelligence, self taught musician and i hope i can defined as artist.

In this website i'll write about art, science and all the stuff i'm intrested in and i think it's worth sharing. Trying maybe to connect them in some way.

## My Studies
I'm currently enrolled in AI master degree in **UniPi** (Pisa, Italy). I'm currently self studying **Computational Neuroscience** and **Dynamical and Complex Systems**. I'm intrested in connections between those two fields and *broadly speaking*: **Machine Learning**. During my master degree i've discovered about how much important is **Probability/Statistical learning theory** for AI methods so i'll focus on that too.

# My passions

I play guitar, i don't currently have particular project but i'm going to start a Skramz/screamo project in the future.
Most of the music i enjoy listening fall in the cathegory of *Post-punk skramz*, can be described as a *violent* emo with some math-rock components, but i also listen a lot to **Jazz Fusion**,**EDM**, **Funk** and bubbly sounding things :*Ambient*.
 I'm also intrested in **Electronic Music** and **Sound Design**, i'm studying also *Production* and *Visual Design*, i think that to be more creative one has to live the art in all the different form and try them by itself.

I'm really good at drawing from references. I'm intrested in **Digital Art** and restoring and coloring my favourite manga panels. Applying math to art is something i'm into too, creating shaders or art programming like live music coding. 

## My Socials
Here i'll post, music and art.
